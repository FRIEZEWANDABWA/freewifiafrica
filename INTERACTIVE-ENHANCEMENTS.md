## 📊 Interactive Features Breakdown

### Real-time Data Simulation
```javascript
// Example of real-time data updates
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setRealTimeData(prev => ({
      activeUsers: prev.activeUsers + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 - 5),
      dataUsage: prev.dataUsage + (Math.random() * 0.1 - 0.05),
      contentViews: prev.contentViews + Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
      satisfaction: Math.max(4.0, Math.min(5.0, prev.satisfaction + (Math.random() * 0.1 - 0.05)))
    }));
  }, 3000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### Animated Counters
```javascript
// Smooth number animations
const animateValue = (start, end, duration) => {
  const increment = end / (duration / 16);
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    start += increment;
    if (start >= end) {
      start = end;
      clearInterval(timer);
    }
    setValue(start);
  }, 16);
